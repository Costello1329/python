<h1>Text generator</h1>

<p1>This program is designed to generate proposals based on probabilistic random selection of words from a given text.</p1>

<p>This program consists of two modules.</p>
<ul>
  <li>When launching the train.py module, specify the path to the directory where the files for parsing are stored. Specify (optional) boolean argument -lc, if you want all characters to be stored in lower case. Specify the path to the file to which you want to display the model.</li>
  <li>Running the generate module, specify the path to the directory in which the model file is stored. Specify (optional) the value of the argument -seed, from which you want to start the generated proposal. Specify the path to the file to which you want to display the response (optional).</li>
</ul>

<i>Each of the modules also has a -help argument, when you call it you can get more help.</i>
